## About Encryption

ALTCHA's Encryption Shield is an automatic, user-friendly encryption system built on the asymmetric RSA algorithm. It secures all employee and customer data, including file attachments.

Submitted form data is encrypted on the server, after validation and processing, and stored in the database encrypted, protecting data from potential data breaches. File attachments are encrypted on the user's device, employing true end-to-end encryption. Only authorized devices with a valid encryption key can decrypt and access protected data.

## About eSignatures

ALTCHA Forms includes support for EU/eIDAS-compliant, legally binding, simple and advanced digital signatures. Simple signatures include hand-written signatures and scanned stamps; advanced signatures include qualified digital certificates (using a signed PDF file) and other formats such as DigiDoc which can be uploaded as attachments.

## Getting Started

To get started with ALTCHA Forms, use the hosted SaaS version:

- [eu.altcha.org/app](https://eu.altcha.org/app) (EU)
- [us.altcha.org/app](https://us.altcha.org/app) (USA)

For self-hosting, follow the instructions below.

## Self-Hosting

### Prerequisites

- Postgres 16+
- Redis 7+
- S3-compatible object store (recommended)
- SMTP server for email

### Docker Compose

Use the provided Dockerfile or docker-compose configuration to start Postgres, Redis, and ALTCHA Forms containers:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

### Database Migration

To apply migrations to the database schema, use the following command (requires Node.js):

```sh
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://...

npx drizzle-kit migrate
```

Alternatively, you can manually create the database tables using a Postgres client and the migration files located in the [/drizzle](/drizzle/) folder.

### Application Access

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/app` and complete the registration to create your account.

### Environment Variables

Configure `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, and `BASE_URL`. See [env.ts](/src/lib/server/env.ts) for all supported variables.

## Roadmap

Some parts of this project are under development. Future enhancements include:

- Search and Analytics: Client-side, end-to-end encrypted search and analysis.
- Bulk Export: Export responses to PDF, CSV, JSON.
- Finalize Identity Management: Anonymized identity linking, search, and management.
